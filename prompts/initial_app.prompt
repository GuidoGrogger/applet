Create a simple app using HTML and JavaScript in one file based on the following description:
--
{description}
--
**Instructions:**

1. **Single File Structure**:
    - The entire application must be contained within a single HTML file, including all necessary JavaScript and CSS.

2. **Local Storage for Data Persistence**:
    - Use only local storage to persist data between page loads.
    - Ensure the app can be reloaded at any time without losing data.

3. **No Authentication or User Management**:
    - Do not include any features related to user authentication or management.

4. **Data Consistency**:
    - Do not store derived or calculated data in local storage.
    - Always compute derived data on the fly to maintain consistency.

5. **Initial Data Generation**:
    - If the app requires initial data, generate it and include it in the local storage section.
    - Ensure that the initial data is structured appropriately and can be modified later as needed.

6. **Output Format**:
    - **HTML Section**: Provide the complete HTML structure, including any necessary JavaScript.
    - **Local Storage Section**: Provide the initial local storage data in JSON format.
    - If initial local storage is not required, you leave it empty or omit it.
    - Make sure that the local storage entries are encoded properly.

Response Structure: Provide the output in the following format without additional explanations:

##BEGIN_HTML##
<html>...
##END_HTML##                    
##BEGIN_LOCAL_STORAGE##
{"entry": "[{\"key1\": ...
##END_LOCAL_STORAGE##
